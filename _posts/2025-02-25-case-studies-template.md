Use *this* post as a template to make your own case study.
**Posts** are stored in the _posts directory and named according to the YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md format as per the usual.

1. Fork the "pages" branch of CMP309 [repository](https://github.com/Mehrpouya/CMP309/tree/pages).
2. In your fork, duplicate this file and name it YOUR_GROUP_APP_TITLE
3. Make sure to place the duplicated file you just made in the _posts folder
3. Use the headers from here as a guidance.
4. Work with your peer and complete your analysis.

# Deconstruct / redesign a mobile app
## What to consider during your analysis
Visualise app main screens, screen relations, the user flow and interaction design

  - Use mind map / flowchart tools such as [sketch.it](https://www.sketch.com/), draw.io, freemind and others to draw your user journeys. These can be [wireflows](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/wireflows/), flow charts or task diagrams.
  - What are your apps main screens? What are the main [layouts](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/mobile/guides/layout-and-content/layout-basics) in each screen? What are your user's main goals? What steps do they take to achieve those goals? What are decision points in your app, whjere users need to choose between options?  
  - Make a list of different [components](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/mobile/guides/components/material-overview) in your app
  - Make a list of app screens and list of components in each screen.
  - What are different paths your users can take? What buttons they can press? What is the relationship between different screens. How does the app guides the user through an experience? What does the app allow the user to do through different screens?
  - Can you categorise / break down types of activities users have in your app? (i.e. onboarding, registering, adding data,...)
  - What data is being stored on the phone and what data is being stored on the cloud?
  - How does the app respond to different interruptions (e.g. being minimised, app closed,...)?
  - What data do you think the app is collecting / should collect to improve user experience.
  - What are the apps entry points, exit points? What steps users take to complete different tasks in your app?
  - No need to do any [reverse engineering, static or dynamic analysis](https://alanbavosa.medium.com/reversing-mobile-apps-the-silent-threat-of-static-analysis-blog-1a9e46a653af)

  This [article](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-journeys-vs-user-flows/) is a good corporate read and has some good points, but nothing is better than you choosing an app and being resourceful and creative in deconstructing it as a group.


## Analyse (1 hour)

- Work with a group of 4 students to deconstruct and analyse a mobile app of your choice.
- Spend 5-10 minutes to choose a mobile app.
- Spend 5-10 minutes to plan how you are going to work as a team?
  - Who is going to produce screengrabs of different screens, someone to create the flowchart,...
- Analyse the app as a group (45 minutes)

## Prepare (30 minutes)

Document your findings as power point presentation / or a Post for this blog.

**Try** to choose something **not** too complex, so you can complete first draft of your analysis during lab time.

## Share
The last 30 minutes, we will go around and look at different case studies different groups conducted.

**Technology behind this blog**
Jekyll and github pages! They both support markdown language. To find out how to use markdown, take a look at the [overview post]

# What is YOUR_GROUP_APP_TITLE
Case study is an in-depth method of research in which you analyse and study a case, an example. In this section provide a brief description of the app. You can use the app page for this.

# Who is this app for (target audience)?  
You don't need to do an extensive market research here, but developing some understanding of how the UI and different features of the app is designed to meet the needs of the apps users.
