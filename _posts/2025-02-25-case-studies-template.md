Use *this* post (located in _posts folder and called "2025-02-25-case-studies-template.md") as a template to make your own case study.
Quick-start guide shows you how to install and use it. No need to follow the quick start unless you are planning to learn more about Jekyll and Github pages.

**Posts** are stored in the _posts directory and named according to the YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md format as per the usual.

**Technology behind this blog**: Jekyll and github pages! They both support markdown language. To find out how to use markdown, take a look at the Quick start guide


# Aim and summary
Our aim today is to get you to analyse an app of your choice working as part of a team.
You can complete today's lab by either writing a post for our CMP309 github pages or use PowerPoint to document your group work.
Only use the Github pages post approach if you feel comfortable with github and would like to learn how to use it as a blogging technology in addition to our lab's activity.

There are two ways to complete today's lab. Either by creating a new post for our github pages repository to present your case study or use PowerPoint to document your analysis.

# Deconstruct / redesign a mobile app
1. Fork the "pages" branch of CMP309 [repository](https://github.com/Mehrpouya/CMP309/tree/pages).
2. In your fork, duplicate this file and name it YOUR_GROUP_APP_TITLE
3. Make sure to place the duplicated file you just made in the _posts folder
3. Read what to consider from below for some guidance.
4. Work with your peers and complete your analysis.

## Analyse (1 hour)

1. Work with a group of **4 students** to deconstruct and analyse a mobile app of your choice.
2. Spend 5-10 minutes to choose a mobile app.
3. Spend 5-10 minutes to plan how you are going to work as a team?
  - Who is going to produce screengrabs of different screens, someone to create the flowchart,...
4. Analyse the app as a group (45 minutes)

## Prepare (30 minutes)

Document your findings as power point presentation / or a Post for this blog.

**Try** to choose something **not** too complex, so you can complete first draft of your analysis during lab time.

## Share (30 minutes)
The last 30 minutes, we will go around and look at different case studies different groups conducted.

## What to consider during your analysis
- Visualise app main screens, screen relations, the user flow and interaction design
- Use mind map / flowchart tools such as [sketch.it](https://www.sketch.com/), draw.io, freemind and others to draw your user journeys. These can be [wireflows](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/wireflows/), flow
charts or task diagrams.




## What is APP_TITLE
Case study is an in-depth method of research in which you analyse and study a case, an example. In this section provide a brief description of the app. You can use the app page for this.

**Report developed by:** Your group members.

## Who is this app for (target audience)?  
You don't need to do an extensive market research here, but developing some understanding of how the UI and different features of the app is designed to meet the needs of the apps users.

## App screen and navigation analysis
Wireflow, flowchart, ....

- App architecture and screen layouts. Map out how the content and features are structured across different screens.
- What are your apps main screens? What are the main [layouts](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/mobile/guides/layout-and-content/layout-basics) in each screen?
- What is the relationship between different screens?
- How does user interacts with navigation and how does that guide them throughout their interaction with your app.

## Action / Task list
- What are your user's main goals? What steps do they take to achieve those goals? What are decision points in your app, where users need to choose between options?  
- What are different paths your users can take? What buttons they can press? How does the app guides the user through an experience? What does the app allow the user to do through different screens?
- What are the apps entry points, exit points? What steps users take to complete different tasks in your app?
- Can you categorise / break down types of activities users have in your app? (i.e. onboarding, registering, adding data,...)
## Components/feature breakdown
- Make a list of different [components](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/mobile/guides/components/material-overview) in your app
- Make a list of app screens and list of components in each screen.
- How does the app respond to different interruptions (e.g. being minimised, app closed,...)?
- What data is being stored on the phone and what data is being stored on the cloud?
- What data do you think the app is collecting / should collect to improve user experience.


> Use connecting arrows or lines to map out users interaction with elements and how they move around to go through different workflows.
  No need to do any [reverse engineering, static or dynamic analysis](https://alanbavosa.medium.com/reversing-mobile-apps-the-silent-threat-of-static-analysis-blog-1a9e46a653af)

  These pages: [article1](https://medium.com/@kshields/user-flow-for-app-development-a-beginners-guide-7968dcad5739), [article2](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-journeys-vs-user-flows/) and [this](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2024/06/how-to-build-an-effective-ux-pipeline-from-user-research-to-usability-testing.php) are good reads and has some good points, but nothing is better than you choosing an app and being resourceful and creative in deconstructing it as a group.
